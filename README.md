https://currencyconverter-peta.herokuapp.com/ is my 1st web app ever, that is completely coded by myself. 

However, it is still work in progress with a lot of room for improvement.

Conversion rates are being fetched from an API available on https://openexchangerates.org/

Tech stack: PostgreSQL as conversion rates database, .NET 5 for the API and Angular 11 for the client app.
